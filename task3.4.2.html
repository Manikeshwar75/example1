    <center> <h2>President Dhaba</h2></center>
    <p> The road no.36 of Jubilee Hills is 'loud-and-clear'ly the party village of the city but its not lawful to limit it to a whoop out audience. For a city full of fun and food lovers, the most happening road in the city oughta welcome all forms of frolic. Those who don't wanna paint the town red every weekend or any day for that matter, may at times like to go to a beautiful, calm place and have a hearty meal. Thankfully, the locality is now filling up the gaps by housing proper fine dine restaurants. One of the best additions to the list is President Dhaba, an exclusive Telugu cuisine restaurant that claims to bring us the deepest secrets from the oldest Kitchens of Telangana. Located on the third floor in the building that houses By The Bottle and President Dhaba, has been making a lot of noise since day1, all for the right reasons.

        Before even you begin to satiate your hankerings for the rich and spicy Telugu food, the mesmerizing interiors will only make you case for choosing the restaurant, stronger. Instead of going with the now-cliche pure South Indian ambiance where you see carved wooden pillars and copper utensils, President Dhaba, has set a fusion of vintage and modern interiors. What you're welcomed by is a well-lit, spacious, spic and span hall with a lounge-like ceiling and modern furniture, while the walls depict the rich ancient art forms from the era. For those who miss the nostalgia, there are dining tables with swinging chairs that are suspended using ropes. Overall its an intelligently done restaurant, setting the right mood for the food served there.
        
        We started with a Kerala style Mutton Soup which had the right mutton flavor, but was too thin and much spicier than what I've had before.
